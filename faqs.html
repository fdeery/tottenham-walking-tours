        <h3>Where is the meeting point?</h3>
        <p>Outside <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/Ln1Q7Ezak5KFd3HE6?g_st=com.google.maps.preview.copy">Tottenham Hotspur Experience</a>.</p>
        
        <h3>Is this a tour about Tottenham Hotspur Football Club?</h3>
        <p>No, we just start at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium because it is a good meeting point.</p>

        <h3>How long is the tour (time)?</h3>
        <p>Two hours, with a 15 minute break half-way through. The tour therefore lasts for <span style="color: green;">two hours and 15 minutes</style> in total.</p>

        <h3>How far will we walk in total (distance)?</h3>
        <p><span style="color: green;">3.3 miles / 5.31 km</span>, on mostly flat terrain. There will be one small hill.</p>

        <h3>Will there be any breaks?</h3>
        <p>Yes, <span style="color: green;">one break of 15 minutes</span>, during which you can sit down, get a coffee, use the bathroom, etc.</p>

        <h3>What should I wear?</h3>
        <p>Anything that you feel comfortable walking 3.3 miles in!</p>

        <h3>Can I take photos?</h3>
        <p>Yes, provided you have the permission of anyone who is going to be in them.</p>

        <h3>Where does the tour finish?</h3>
        <p>Outside <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/YyPqcAEpsVmi4qh1A?g_st=com.google.maps.preview.copy">The High Cross Pub</a>. Note that this is *not* the same place that the tour starts, but is on the same street and within sight of the stadium.</p>

        <h3 style="color: grey;">I still have an unanswered question.</h3>
